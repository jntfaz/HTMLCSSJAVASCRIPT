 <p>This site uses the clash of clan website to display knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
 <p>Per the W3Schools tutorial, you can view source of a page through the specific browser.  I was using MicroSoft Edge so I had to hit F12 to view it</p>
 <p>After pulling in the initial code to my index file, i stripped out the content that was not relevant for my example.  I just wanted to have the  menu</p>
 <p>across the top with a few options and i wanted to embed some video in the HTML pages.  Lastly I wanted to use a CSS file and JavaScript so I created this</p>
 <p>About page to put some of those options in it.  I learned a lot but theres a ton more to learn that 1 week is not enough.  I plan to continue learning.</p>
